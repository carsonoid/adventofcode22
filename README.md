# Advent of Code 2022

Now with more Java ☕☕☕

## Viewing tThe Slides

This repo includes a short presentation on on my thoughts as a Go developer writing Java.

It uses `go present` to view the slides and code. Run it by installing the `present` tool and running:

```bash
present -use_playground=false -base theme
```
